				<h2><a href="#">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. "Heavy Is the Head" (An Episode Review)</a></h2>
<h3>by Kaitlin Thomas</h3>

				<div class="col-md-12"><img src="img/story_1.png"></div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>In its ﬁrst season, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. relied heavily on a 
procedural format with overarching larger thematic storylines, like 
the ones concerning the Clairvoyant and Coulson's mysterious 
return from the dead. But once Hydra was unmasked as the Big 
Bad and Ward's betrayal was revealed in "Turn, Turn, Turn," the 
series mostly swapped the one-and-done thing for more heavily 
serialized drama, and it looks like that might be the new normal. 
The procedural format works well for many shows, and in theory 
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been a procedural, but I think it's pretty ob-
vious by now that the show is much more successful when it en-
gages in long-form storytelling. We're two episodes deep in Season 
2, and "Heavy Is the Head" picked up exactly where "Shadows" left 
oﬀ, and because of that, the momentum from the premiere car-
ried over.</p>


<p>This week, Absorbing Man was still on the loose with the mysteri-
ous Obelisk. May was hot on his trail, Hunter was scooped up by 
Talbot and his men, Skye was anxious to get back out into the ﬁeld 
to assist May, Fitz was still struggling to prove that he's not a 
worthless member of the team, and Coulson was trying to be a 
fearless leader in the face of everything that went wrong. Ward 
was M.I.A., but I think that's to be expected since he's currently 
imprisoned in the Playground's basement. Because the show isn't 
currently doing stories-of-the-week, it's not that easy to incorpo-
rate him, and that's perfectly ﬁne. He'll make a good asset when 
the team needs information on Hydra, and he'll deﬁnitely continue 
to factor into Skye's arc, but I think S.H.I.E.L.D. is right to keep him 
out of sight for a bit. Trying to ﬁnd ways to shoehorn him in every 
week would ring false and make him seem more useful than he 
actually is, as if the show and its characters couldn't exist without 
him. But I think the team is doing just ﬁne now that Ward is locked 
up—well, as ﬁne as can be after everything went wrong in "Shad-
ows." And part of the reason for that is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s decision to 
essentially replace Ward with Tripp and newcomers Lance Hunter 
(Nick Blood) and Mack (Henry Simmons).</p>


<img src="img/story_2.png">

<p>We didn't get to spend much time with Hunter and Mack last week, 
but "Heavy Is the Head" more than made up for that. Mack took an 
interest in Fitz, which eventually led to him modifying a gadget that 
Fitz had previously designed in order to destabilize the molecules 
in Creel's skin, thus allowing Coulson to turn him fully to stone. I 
was initially very upset last week when the rest of the team 
seemed to have written Fitz oﬀ as a lost cause, but as the "Heavy Is 
the Head" progressed, it became clear that they simply weren't the 
right people to ﬁx him. They knew him back when he was one half 
of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Dynamic (Science) Duo, but Mack has only ever 
known the current version of Fitz, which means there's no risk of 
Fitz not living up to his potential. It's easy to imagine a scenario in 
which May, Skye, Simmons, or Coulson would ﬁnd it diﬃcult to 
reconcile this new version with the old one, and thus get frustrated 
when things didn't work out. But with Mack, that problem doesn't 
exist. No, FitzMack doesn't roll oﬀ the tongue the way FitzSimmons 
does, and he's certainly no replacement for the real thing, but it's 
nice that Fitz has someone to talk to so he's not always mumbling 
to himself or blabbering at Head Simmons.</p>
<p>On the Hunter front, we learned that he's a sensitive but dou-
ble-crossing jerk who looks at S.H.I.E.L.D. as a job rather than a 
lifestyle (which is how Skye has come to view it). After Talbot 
snatched him, he negotiated his own deal in exchange for giving 
up Coulson, and in addition to his hefty price tag, he also insisted 
that Lucy Lawless receive a proper burial, one that didn't tarnish 
her name since S.H.I.E.L.D. is considered a terrorist organization. It 
was a telling moment, and it only added to my growing interest in 
Hunter. I like that he's predictably unpredictable, and I think he's a 
good man for the team to have around. He's a free-thinker, and 
even if he's always looking out for number one, he's got an exciting 
energy about him. </p>

<img src="img/story_3.png">
<p>Which brings us to Coulson. Part of what made Coulson such a 
popular character in the Marvel ﬁlms was his genial—if strict—na-
ture, and his earnest desire to do the right thing. But back then, 
Coulson didn't have to deal with the big picture; he was a company 
man and a true fanboy, but he took orders from Nick Fury. Now 
he's trying to strike the perfect balance between "team leader" and 
"organization leader," and he hasn't gotten there yet. Even though 
his ranks are outnumbered by your local Boy Scout troop, it'd be 
ridiculously unbelievable if Coulson just slipped into Fury's shoes 
with ease. As director, Fury made a lot of tough calls, and I don't 
think you can really say he's a good man the way you can with 
Coulson. But Coulson is operating on a much larger scale now, and 
he can't aﬀord to be as single-minded. I think Coulson is a good 
leader on the small scale, but whether or not he's cut out for lead-
ing S.H.I.E.L.D. as a whole still remains to be seen. </p>
